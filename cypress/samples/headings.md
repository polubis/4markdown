# The Ultimate Guide to Web Development

## Introduction to Web Development

Web development has come a long way. It all started with basic HTML and CSS, but today, the landscape is far more complex and dynamic.

### The Basics: HTML & CSS

HTML is the backbone of the web, while CSS brings design and layout to life. Every website starts here.

#### JavaScript: The Heart of Interactivity

Without JavaScript, web pages would remain static. JS adds interactivity, making websites feel alive.

##### Frameworks and Libraries: Boosting Productivity

From React to Vue, frameworks and libraries simplify building complex web applications.

###### Advanced Topics: Server-Side Development

While front-end development is critical, server-side code powers the backend. Understanding Node.js, databases, and API design is essential.
