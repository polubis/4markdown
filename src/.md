> I want to warn you that the complexity of TypeScript is about to increase significantly (ï¿£ï¸¶ï¿£)â†—. We will need to use a lot of generics, type constraints, mapped types, and type inference combined with type guards. I'll do my best to explain everything clearly, but this article focuses on the nature of tuples themselves, not on advanced TypeScript topics. If you encounter any issues, I recommend reading additional articles on those subjects.

# **TypeScript** Tuples Are Not Tuples In **JavaScript**

I dislike creating clickbait article titles, but I couldn't think of a better name. This is because TypeScript is a somewhat unusual technology. Without JavaScript, it's just a fancy linter. So, if the standalone TypeScript tuples implementation works correctly, combining it with JavaScript can be misleading and false by the definition of a tuple. 

> A **tuple** is a data structure similar to an array, but its structure should be blocked from modification. Once the structure is defined at the beginning of a program, it cannot be changed later.

In this typical case of the strange JS/TS relationship, everything seems legitimate in TypeScript. However, when you start connecting TS definitions with JS implementations, you encounter issues (I'm sure you've experienced this situation).

Today, we'll examine tuples in TypeScript, see how they integrate with JavaScript, and compare their behavior to the general tuple definition.

## **Tuples** In TypeScript

Many languages implements tuples in different ways. Take a look at a typical tuple in TypeScript:

```javascript
let tuple: [string, number, boolean] = ["hello", 42, true];
```

It's just an array with a fixed number of elements, and we know the exact type of each element at a specific index. Yes, and it's really close to the definition we might assign to such a data structure. But here comes the problem: if it should have a fixed length, why does TypeScript allow us to change the "structure" of a tuple using `pop()`?

```javascript
let tuple: [string, number, boolean] = ["hello", 42, true];

tuple = []; // ðŸ’¥ "Must have at least 3 elements"
tuple = ["d", 1, false];
tuple = [1]; // ðŸ’¥ "Number is not assignable to type string"
tuple[1] = 1; // It works.
tuple[0] = true; // ðŸ’¥ "Boolean is not assignable to type string"
tuple.pop(); // ðŸ’” Why does this work???
```

This can produce ugly bugs at runtime - you'll assume that the length of the array is fixed and the elements have the correct types, but you know, JavaScript and TypeScript are totally separate entities. It's like a cherry on top of an ice cream cake: TypeScript just decorates the ugliness of JS with the cherry, but it doesn't prevent the cake from tasting bad. So, you're able to do risky stuff like this:

```javascript
const reverse = (arr: any[]) => {
  return arr.reverse();
};

reverse(tuple); // Good luck...

// or

tuple.sort(); // Good luck 2x...

// or

tuple.reverse(); // Good luck 3x...
```

That's one of the reasons why TypeScript provides the as const syntax - to create tuples in a more "strict" way by adding a readonly annotation by default. This removes the suggestions for mutable methods when typing `dot`.

*Three Elements Tuple*

The same effect can be achieved by wrapping our explicitly defined tuple with the `Readonly` utility type.

```javascript
let tuple: Readonly<[string, number, boolean]> = ["hello", 42, true];
```

Now, we've totally blocked the option to mutate the tuple from TypeScript's perspective.

*Push Method Does Not Exist in Tuple*

But you know, it's just type annotation, so we can ignore it if we don't have strictly set **compiler options** or a good **ESLint** configuration, and we can still change the structure at runtime...

```javascript
const reverse = (arr: any[]) => {
  return arr.reverse();
};

reverse(tuple); // Good luck...
```

The way TypeScript and JavaScript cooperate has created a misleading definition and understanding of tuples for web developers. This is mainly because JavaScript is a dynamically typed language (the types are determined at runtime when the code is executed), while TypeScript is a statically typed language (essentially an add-on to JavaScript with a completely separate system that tries to add static typing), similar to languages like C# or Java. However, it cannot do this perfectly because JavaScript is too dynamic to allow for such strict typing. That's why every type annotation can be easily bypassed using `any` or with loose compiler option settings.

Next, the problem is that sometimes TypeScript aims to introduce features for better static typing, like tuples, but JavaScript does not have any built-in mechanism for that. This leads to nice static type definitions, but a lack of mechanisms to support these features at runtime.

> JavaScript recognizes `arrays` but not `tuples`. Arrays are 100% dynamic: their length can change, and virtually everything about them is mutable, from their internal data structures to their external shape and the values they contain.

## What Is A **Tuple** Really?

So, one more time:

> A **tuple** is a data structure similar to an array, but its structure should be blocked from modification. Once the structure is defined at the beginning of a program, it cannot be changed later.

This means that if we've defined a tuple like `[1, '1', true]`, we shouldn't be able to add new elements at the beginning, middle, or end, or change their order - that's a change of structure. A tuple should block that option by definition.

However, the values may be modified. So, let's say we want to modify the first element of the tuple that is typed as `number`. We can assign another `number`, but if we try to assign a `string` to its position, that would be a change of structure as well.

But isn't that a change of value, not the structure itself? From one perspective, yes, but from another, no. Imagine you have a rectangle, and you want to change it to a circle. That's a change of structure. If you assign it to a variable, it looks like a change of the variable. The same stays true when you're changing tuple values - it's a structural change.

From the previous heading, it's clear that creating a tuple in TypeScript is valuable only at compile time. At runtime, it's totally wild west - we can do whatever we want. This needs to be improved by providing a JavaScript implementation and then adding the correct type definitions on top of it (we'll deal with this in the next sections). But before that, let's summarize what a tuple is and how it works with a checklist.

1. Once defined, the structure (length, order, data types under each element) is unchangeable.
2. The length is statically known and consistent.
3. We can modify each element of the tuple, but only when the type remains the same.

> Some tuples may be entirely immutable and constant, meaning we will not be able to change any part of their initially defined structure or the values of their elements, even if they are of the same type. This depends on our use case. Sometimes we want the option to modify certain values, and sometimes we do not.

Languages like Swift allow you to create two variants easily:

```javascript
// Immutable tuple
let person: (name: String, age: Int, isStudent: Bool) = ("Alice", 25, true)
// Mutable tuple
var person: (name: String, age: Int, isStudent: Bool) = ("Alice", 25, true)
```

## Implementing **Real Tuple**

Taking into account all the requirements mentioned in the previous heading, let's implement a tuple that will strive to be [type-safe](https://4markdown.com/using-zod-and-typescript-to-write-type-safe-code/), meaning the same structure will be preserved at both compile time and runtime.

We'll start with the API signature design:

```javascript
const tuple = Tuple([1, 'tom', true, { flag: true }, ['hi']], {
  // Allows modification of element values when the same types are maintained.
  mutable: true,
});

// Returns either Readonly<[1, 'tom', true, { flag: true }, ['hi']]> or 
// [1, 'tom', true, { flag: true }, ['hi']] based on the mutable flag.
tuple.read();
// Returns the value { flag: true }.
tuple.getAt(3);
// Allows you to map through the elements of the tuple.
tuple.map((item) => {
  // Your logic. Creates a completely new data structure 
  // without modifying the original.
});

// Can only be used when the "mutable" flag is truthy. 
// Otherwise, it does not exist.
tuple.set(1, 'tom');
```

To begin with a simple implementation, we need a mechanism that "detects" if the passed `mutable` flag is `true`. If it is, it should return the `MutableTuple`; if not, it should return the `ImmutableTuple`. To simplify: based on the flag, we'll return different objects with some common methods and properties. However, the `MutableTuple` will have an additional mechanism to change the value of each tuple element (provided the type remains the same as initially set).

```javascript
interface TupleOptions {
  mutable: boolean;
}

type TupleBase<T extends unknown[]> = {
  map<U>(callback: (item: T[number]) => U): U[];
};

type ImmutableTuple<T extends unknown[]> = TupleBase<T> & {
  read(): Readonly<T>;
  getAt<K extends keyof T>(index: K): Readonly<T[K]>;
};

type MutableTuple<T extends unknown[]> = TupleBase<T> & {
  set<K extends keyof T>(index: K, value: T[K]): void;
  read(): Readonly<T>;
  getAt<K extends keyof T>(index: K): Readonly<T[K]>;
};

type Tupleable<
  T extends unknown[],
  O extends TupleOptions,
> = O['mutable'] extends true ? MutableTuple<T> : ImmutableTuple<T>;
```

These are the only type definitions we need to provide a great developer experience when using our tuple. The `T extends unknown[]` syntax is important here. It means that the values of the tuple we pass must be at least an array. This makes sense since a tuple is a more specific type of array with certain limitations for specific use cases.

We've used `unknown` to force us to check the real type with **type guards** and then perform certain operations. This is similar to error handling:

```javascript
} catch (e: unknown) {
  // Before doing anything, we need to check 
  // exactly what the error object is using if statements.
}
```

Everything else should be straightforward. The `&` operator is used to merge two types and avoid repetition. The `Tupleable` type might be a bit unclear. It's a conditional type that takes our generic array `T` and a generic `O` type, which must fulfill the `TupleOptions` interface. Based on the internal `mutable` property, we perform a check and return different types accordingly, passing the generic `T` to these types.

Interestingly, the `<K extends keyof T>` syntax in the context of an array allows us to select the `index` that acts like a "key" and remember the type associated with its value using the `T[K]` syntax.

Now, it's time to write some runtime code, combined with the definitions we've created.

```javascript
const Tuple = <T extends unknown[], O extends TupleOptions>(
  elements: [...T],
  options: O,
): Tupleable<T, O> => {
  // Wait for implementation.
};
```

Here, we have a magic syntax `[...T]`. Think of it as a mechanism that takes an array and transforms it into a tuple for the "generics". So, our elements are now a tuple transformed from the given array, passed as the `elements` variable.

We need to check the value of the `mutable` property and then return different objects according to the shapes of `MutableTuple` and `ImmutableTuple`. Let's handle the `mutable = true` case first:

```javascript
// Inside "Tuple" function.
if (options.mutable) {
  const mutableTuple: MutableTuple<T> = {
    read() {
      return Object.freeze([...elements]) as Readonly<T>;
    },
    getAt(index) {
      return Object.freeze(elements[index]);
    },
    map(callback) {
      return elements.map(callback);
    },
    set(index, value) {
      if (typeof value !== typeof elements[index]) {
        throw new Error(
          `New value must be of the same type as the existing value`,
        );
      }
      elements[index] = value;
    },
  };

  return mutableTuple;
}
```

Once you use `Object.freeze` on an array, you cannot change, add, or remove elements from that array. But the question is: why are we using `[...elements]` in the `read()` method? We want to block the option for modification by external consumers - the code that will use our `Tuple` - but we still want to be able to use `set` on the original data. This should be the only possible way of changing the tuple values. That's why we've created a totally new array with the `[...elements]` syntax, to return a new array that cannot be modified at all, while exposing the `set` method to allow modification of the array with only one single function.
