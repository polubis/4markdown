## Architecture

It's based on the following building blocks:

- From the `React` perspective:

1. **Component**
   - Application specific, f.e `UsersList` or `PostsTable`
   - Design system component (app agnostic), f.e `Modal` or `Button`
2. **Container**
3. **View**
4. **Page**
   - May be `static`
   - May be `dynamic`

- From the `State Management` perspective:

5. **Store**

- From an `API communication` perspective:

6. **Service**
7. **Queries**

From a `storage` and `browser databases` perspective:

8. **Repository**

The architecture graph looks as follows when we include hierarchies:
